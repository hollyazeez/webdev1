        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find at least 2 players, works best with 4-5</li>
            <li>Use a standard 52 card deck.</li>
            <li>Deal three cards to each player face down. Do not look at them.</li>
            <li>Deal three cards to each player face up. Place them on top of the face down cards.</li>
            <li>Deal three more cards to each player. These become the player's hand.</li>
            <li>The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The main objective to get rid of all of your cards. Players take turns playing cards that are higher than or equal to the previous card played. This is based on the standard ace's high order: numerical value, jacks, queens, kings, aces. The exception that being 2s, 3s, and 10s act as various wild cards.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2s drop the value of the current card to zero.</li>
            <li>3s mirror the previous card played.
            </li>
            <li>10s clear the pile and allow the player to go again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These wild cards can be played on any other card, regarless of numerical value. However, this order must be followed if you are playing a wild on top of another wild.</p>
        <p>Ex. You cannot play a 6 on and 8, but you can play a 2 on an 8. However, you cannot play a 2 on a 3.</p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>Before the gameplay begins, players are given the opportunity to trade the cards in their hand with the face up cards in front of them. You want the face up cards to be the three best cards you have.</p>
        <p>The game starts with the lowest card being played. Starting to left of the dealer, players are asked if they have a 4 (the lowest non-wild card). The first player with a 4 gets to play frist. If no player has a 4, the precess continues with a 5, and so on.</p>
        <p>Moving in a clockwise direction, players take turns playing a card from their hand that is equal to the previous card, higher than the previous card, or a wild. If a player has two of the same number, they may play both of them in the same turn. At the end of each turn, the players must draw cards from the center deck to replace the ones they playerd. All players must have at least three cards in their hand. Once the deck runs out of cards, players continue playing without drawing new cards.</p>
        <p>If a player does not have a card to play, they must pick up the entire pile of cards that have been played. Since the next player does not have a card to play on,they are playing on a zero (so any card can be played). The player who picked up the pile no longer has to draw after their turn since they have more than three cards. Once they are back to only three cards in their hand, the continue drawing like usual.</p>
        <p>If at any point all four of the same number have been played in a row (or separated by only wilds), the pile is cleared. The player who played the fourth card is also allowed to play again.</p>
        <p>Once players have played all of the cards in their hand, they move onto the face up cards. These cards are played in a similar fashion the cards in a player's hand. However, if a player must pick up the pile, the card remains face up and is not placed in the players hand. When a player picks up the pile, they must play the cards in their hand before they return to playing the face up cards.</p>
        <p>Once a player gets rid of the three face up cards, they move on to the face down cards. These cards are blindly flipped. Without knowing the value of the card, the player flips it over on their turn. If it is playable, the turn is over. If not, the player must pick up the pile.</p>
        <p>Once a player has played all of their blind flips and has no cards left in thier hand, they sit back while the other players continue. The game ends when only one player has cards left. There is no winner in Amsterdam, only one loser.</p>

        <h2>Quick Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Remember 2s, 3s, and 10s are wild.</li>
            <li>Remember to always have a least three cards in your hand.</li>
            <li>Save wilds for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>Having pairs in your face up cards can help you get through them faster.</li>
            <li>If you have a 10 in your face up cards, try to save it for last. Since it clears the pile and lets you play again, it basically creates a free blind flip.</li>
            <li>If you manage to get a a four of a kind, play it ASAP so that you get to another turn to play on a blank plie.</li>
            <li>When someone else is playing their face up cards, you can play something higher than what they have and force them to pick up the pile.</li>
        </ul>
