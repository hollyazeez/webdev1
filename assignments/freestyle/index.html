        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find at least 2 players, works best with 4-5</li>
            <li>Use a standard 52 card deck.</li>
            <li>Deal three cards to each player face down. Do not look at them.</li>
            <li>Deal three cards to each player face up. Place them on top of the face down cards.</li>
            <li>Deal three more cards to each player. These become the player's hand.</li>
            <li>The remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How to Start</h2>
        <p>The main goal is to get rid of all of your cards. Players take turns playing cards that are higher than or equal to the previous card played. This is based on the standard ace's high order: numerical value, jacks, queens, kings, aces. The exception that being 2s, 3s, and 10s act as various wild cards.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2s drop the value of the current card to zero.</li>
            <li>3s mirror the previous card played.
            </li>
            <li>10s clear the pile and allow the player to go again.</li>
        </ul>
